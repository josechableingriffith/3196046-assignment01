Behind every Rauw Alejandro show lies a level of physical demands comparable to that of a professional athlete. To deliver performances that combine singing, intense dancing and acrobatic movements, the artist maintains a rigorous training routine that has become an essential part of his identity as a performer.

His routine includes a strategic mix of cardio, functional training, strength work, joint mobility and Muay Thai-inspired sessions. This type of preparation allows him to maintain cardiovascular endurance for more than two hours of performance, avoiding fatigue and ensuring precision in his choreography.

Rauw recognises that his physical approach directly influences his artistic endeavours: the better his condition, the greater his ability to improvise, dance and connect with the audience without compromising his voice. His discipline has been highlighted by fitness media outlets, which consider him one of the most physically fit artists in the urban industry.

This combination of music, dance and athleticism has elevated his shows to a higher level, setting him apart in today's music scene. His commitment is proof that success on stage depends not only on talent, but also on perseverance and daily preparation.
