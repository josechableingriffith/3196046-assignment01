The Mexican public has once again demonstrated its enormous affection for Rauw Alejandro. After quickly selling out the initial dates of the Cosa Nuestra World Tour in Monterrey, Guadalajara, and Mexico City, the artist announced new additional dates for November 2025, significantly expanding his presence in the country.

The pre-sale became a national trend, making it clear that Mexico is one of the singer's strongest markets. The addition of new dates responds to thousands of requests from fans who were unable to get tickets, a phenomenon that reaffirms Rauw's impact on the Latin American music scene.

The concerts in Mexico promise a revamped stage show, energetic dancing and a repertoire that combines hits such as "Todo de Ti", "Lokera" and "Reloj" with new songs from the Cosa Nuestra era. The emotional connection that the artist has with Mexican audiences is a key element: his style, energy and presence have created a close and lasting relationship.

The extension of the tour positions Mexico as a key stop on the global tour and promises some of the most memorable nights of their 2025 concert cycle.
